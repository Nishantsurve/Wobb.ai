## Component Structure & State Management
### Overview
Explain the key components, how they interact, and how state is managed.

### Hooks Used
- `useState` for managing local state
- `useEffect` for side effects
- `useContext` for global state management (if applicable)

### State Management Approach
- Describe whether you're using React Context, Redux, or any other state management solution.

## Technologies Used
- React.js
- React Router (if applicable)
- Tailwind CSS / Styled Components (if applicable)
- Any other libraries used

## Design Choices
### Color Scheme
- The color palette consists of a primary color, a secondary color, and neutral tones.
- The primary color (e.g., `#3498db` for blue) is used for primary actions and emphasis.
- The secondary color (e.g., `#2ecc71` for green) is used for success messages and highlights.
- Neutral tones (shades of gray) are used for backgrounds and text to ensure readability.

### Typography
- The project uses `Inter` as the primary font for a modern and clean look.
- Headings (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`) are bold and use larger sizes for clear hierarchy.
- Body text is set to a comfortable reading size (`16px` or `1rem`).
- Line spacing and letter spacing are optimized for readability.

### Spacing & Layout
- The layout follows a `12-column grid` system for responsiveness.
- Consistent spacing (`8px`, `16px`, `32px`) is used for padding and margins.
- Components are spaced appropriately to maintain a clean and uncluttered interface.
- Flexbox and CSS Grid are used for alignment and layout management.
